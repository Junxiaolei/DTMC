Description: This package introduces some methods to analyze some properties of discrete time Markov chain,
    including Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, classification of states, Long-run Proportions, Stationary Probability,
    Limiting Probability, Time Reversiblilty and so on. These methods can be used to describe the characteristics of
    a stochastic process with Markov property.
