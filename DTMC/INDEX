Abprob                  Calculating probability when the absorbing
                        state is known Calculate the conditional
                        probability of transferring n steps from state
                        i to state j, given never entering absorb state
                        in this n steps. In real life, there may be
                        known discrete Markov chains that never enter a
                        state k1, k2...  This function can help
                        calculate the conditional probability of moving
                        from state i to state j in n steps in this
                        case.  All we need to do is considering the
                        states k1,k2... as absorbing state to put into
                        this function and enter the transition matrix P
                        and state i and state j.  The function outputs
                        the final probability. If absorbing state
                        contain state i or j, the function will return
                        the probability of having entered the absorbing
                        states in these n steps.

                        whether state i and state j are communicative.
                        That state i and state j are communicative
                        means that there is a step from state i that is
                        possible to move to state j and there is a step
                        from state j that is possible to move to state
                        i. The state i should not equal to state j. If
                        you want to verify that a state can return to
